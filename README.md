# E-commerce Website Project

## Project Description

This project is a responsive e-commerce website where customers can browse products, save favorites, log into their accounts, and make purchases. The application is built using a full-stack approach with Node.js and Express powering the backend, and Next.js with Tailwind CSS for the frontend. The system integrates with a MySQL database to manage user accounts, product inventory, and orders.

### Purpose
